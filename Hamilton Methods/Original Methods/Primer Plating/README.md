METHOD FOR DILUTING AND ALIQUOTING PRIMER TO PLATE:

This method aliquots a pre-specified volume of a primer from a tube to a dilution plate (in this case a 96 well Nunc plate)

and aliquots a pre-specified volume of a diluent to said dilution plate.

Following this, the entire diluted volume is transferred to a 96 well deep well block and a mapping file of the final destination sequence is generated.
