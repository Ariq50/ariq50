SIMPLE ALIQUOTING METHOD FOR TRANSFERING LIQUID FROM A SOURCE TROUGH TO MULTIPLE DESTINATION PLATES:

This method aliquots a preset volume of solution (in this example, 50 uL of ezyme solution per tip) from a source trough to a series of destination plates, 

using a combination of Single and Smart Steps.

In addition, the HSL TipCounting library is used to keep track of the number of tips used and adjust the tip sequence at run time.

At the end of a run, a mapping file of the destination sequence is generated.
