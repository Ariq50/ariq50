METHOD FOR ALIQUOTING PRE-SET VOLUME OF MEDIA FROM TROUGH TO TUBES:

This method aliquots a pre-set volume of media from a trough to a series of tubes. The media carrier and tip carrier are manually loaded onto the deck using

Single Steps and the tube carriers are autoloaded using Smart Steps. After aliquoting to the first four tube carriers, said carriers are unloaded from the deck, using a Smart Step.

The next group of four tube carriers is then aliquoted to and unloaded from the deck, followed by the final group of four tube carriers. At the end of the run, a series of mapping

files are generated, each associated with a separate tube carrier sequence.
