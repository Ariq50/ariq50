Method for Aliquoting and Mixing Reagent and Buffer Solution:

This method aliquots user specified volumes of a reagent and a buffer from two seperate troughs into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The deck is loaded manually,

with the operator filling the reagent and buffer troughs prior to running the method. The operator is then prompted to enter the starting volume and concentration of the reagent,

as well as the target number of samples for the run. From these inputs, the volumes of the reagent and buffer to be aliquoted are calculated.

Next, the reagent and buffer are aliquoted in two seperate loops, until all the required volume has been transferred to the target tubes.

The deck is then unloaded and the tubes removed for further processing by the operator(s).
